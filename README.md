Python State Machines
=====================

A python state machines library inspired by the [Java Swing States][appert06] library.

Offers two standard syntaxes for creating state machines: a pure-python syntax using decorators and an altered python syntax with two new keywords: State and Transition.  *(TODO: document these.  In the mean time, see the smTest.py and pysmTest.py files.)*
